# php_openssl_encrypt
PHP code to decrypt an encrypted PDF file and output it to the browser

For Example.pdf  encrypting  
```php
encryptPdf('example.pdf', 'example-encrypted.pdf', 'my_password');
```

Result output example-encrypted.pdf on Browser

```php
$decryptedData = decryptPdf('example-encrypted.pdf', 'my_password');
header('Content-type: application/pdf');
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="example.pdf"');
echo $decryptedData;
```


The code I provided is a basic example of how to download an encrypted file using SSL and decrypt it using OpenSSL in PHP. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind when implementing this in a production environment to ensure security and reliability.

Firstly, the SSL certificate used for encryption should be obtained from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and should be up to date. Using a self-signed or expired SSL certificate can compromise the security of the transmission.

Secondly, the key used for encryption and decryption should be properly secured. It should not be hard-coded in the code or transmitted in plaintext. Instead, it should be stored securely on the server and accessed only by authorized users.

Finally, it is important to sanitize and validate any user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, while the code I provided is a good starting point, it is essential to consider these security measures and best practices to ensure a reliable and secure implementation.
